## Challenge description
Background: Woboinc develops software in Ruby & Javascript.  We primarily use Ruby on Rails and node.js.  For our front-end development we use jQuery and Bootstrap, but are actively pursuing work in AngularJS and Foundation.

Objective: One of our clients wants to build a simple interface for college students to find textbooks for classes in which they are enrolled.  Using the [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html), we need you to build a simple search interface.  This interface should search for BOOKS only (not other products on Amazon).  That is, products suitable for a classroom.  Once searched, the results should be displayed in a simple and easy-to-read manner.

Indvidual titles in search results should include the following information:
- Book Title
- Author Name
- Publisher Name
- Publication Date
- Edition (if available)
- Price
- Format (i.e. Hardcover, Paperback, Kindle Edition, etc.)

It is up to you, the developer, to focus on backend or front-end work.  If you focus on backend work, we will not critique your front-end development.  If you focus on front-end work, we will not critique your backend integrations.
